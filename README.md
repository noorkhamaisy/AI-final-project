# AI---final-project
This project seeks to explore the capabilities of multi-agent search algorithms in a competitive setting, focusing on optimizing the performance of iRobots in a room-cleaning task.

## Can't Go Back Game

Optimizing iRobot performance in room cleaning is a practical and engaging problem, representing a real-world application of multi-agent search algorithms. Multiple autonomous agents (iRobots) navigate and clean a shared environment, aiming to minimize redundant actions and maximize cleaning efficiency. This scenario mirrors real-life tasks like household cleaning and highlights competitive dynamics in multi-agent systems, an expanding field in robotics and AI. To solve this, we used the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning and Q-Learning, enabling strategic decision-making. We also implemented time management to ensure efficient, timely moves by the robots.
